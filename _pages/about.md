I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University.
My research focuses on comparative political institutions, especially in autocracies, and international political economy, particularly exchange rates and sovereign debt.
In my dissertation, I combine both interests by studying how institutions governing succession in autocracies affect access to foreign finance and investment.
I also study how leader survival affects political outcomes, such as using leader survival to explain the adoption of institutions.

Above, you can find links to a list of current working papers and the most recent copy of my CV.
