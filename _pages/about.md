I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University specializing in comparative politics and international relations. My research interests focus on the politics of dictatorships, particularly the origins and consequences of autocratic institutions, and international political economy. My dissertation studies how dictatorships regulate succession and how succession rules can increase access to foreign finance such as sovereign debt and foreign direct investment.

Above, you can find links to a list of current working papers and the most recent copy of my CV.
