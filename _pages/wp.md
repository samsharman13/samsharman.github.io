## [Autocratic Survival and the Introduction of Succession Rules](/files/SharmanAutocratic_wp.pdf)

*Abstract*: Why do autocrats have succession rules and successors?
According to a recent wave of research, autocrats have succession rules when they expect to lose power.
Successors increase certainty over the regime's future and protect the autocrat from coups.
Previous work assumes that autocrats have succession rules when endangered and tests the effects of succession rules on survival.
In contrast, I argue that secure autocrats are more likely to have succession rules because they can prevent coups from successors and ambitious elites.
I conduct the first test of whether survival probability influences having succession rules and a create a novel measurement of survival probability using machine learning.
I find support for my argument.
Higher survival probabilities increase the probability of having succession rules and successors.
My results suggest that the relationship between succession rules and survival needs to be revisited.
They also demonstrate the importance of studying institutions' causes for studying autocracies.
To understand the effects of institutions, we need to understand their causes.

## [Labor Mobility and Semi-Presidentialism](/files/SharmanSemi_wp.pdf)

*Abstract*: Political scientists frequently argue that presidential and parliamentary democracies produce different policy outcomes but fail to fully consider semi-presidential democracies.
To demonstrate the importance of considering semi-presidentialism, I reanalyze an existing argument that presidential democracies have more labor mobility than parliamentary democracies because presidential democracies empower special interests who support immigration.
I replicate previous analyses and find little evidence that the type of democracy affects labor mobility. Political scientists need to consider semi-presidentialism or risk erroneous inferences.
Further, theories of institutions and immigration policy, and institutional theories more generally, should focus on more specific institutions rather than rely on the blunt distinctions between types of democracies.

*Status*: Updated May 9, 2023. Under review.
